# Getting Started

The API is very simple and uses a Push/Pull method. Data we export to you will be ``POST``ed to your defined endpoint and the data we import from you will be read from a URL you specify. Both of these requests will either be in ``JSON`` or ``XML`` and are defined in your configuration file

When we push data to you, you must ensure that you give a valid response code in the header, these can either be:

+ 200 (OK)
+ 400 (Bad request or bad data sent)
+ 500 (Error)

Error codes will make the API try again, therefore if you do not respond with a 200(OK) you experience duplicate data.

# Config File

Your configuration file should be publicly accessible via a URL and is specified within the Khaos Control Cloud application. Once our API knows about this file it will cache it once a day, or, you can force a manual update from within Khaos Control Cloud. To do this you will need to change the ``Configuration URL`` field within Khaos Control Cloud, save the document, and then change it back to what it was originally.

## Structure

The data structure must be wrapped inside an ``EndpointConfig`` property and can consist of one or more of the following objects:

Object | Property | Description
--- | --- | ---
**[OrderDownload](#order-download)** | | The endpoint for where your orders can be imported into Khaos Control Cloud
| | URL | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Frequency | How frequently (, in minutes,) the endpoint will be contacted
| | Format | The format of the file you have produced, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[OrderStatusUpload](#order-status-upload)** | | The endpoint of where the status information will be POSTed to
| | URL | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Format | The format of which to export the information, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[StockStatusUpload](#stock-status-upload)** | | This will define the endpoint to sync Stock Statuses
| | URL | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Format | The format of which to export the information, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[StockUpload](#stock-upload)** | | The endpoint of where stock is exported to, so you can update this on your website. See ``StockExport`` for details on the data being exported to you
| | URL | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Format | The format of which to export the information, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[CReturnDownload](#customer-return-download)** | | The endpoint for where your customer returns can be imported into Khaos Control Cloud
| | URL | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Frequency | How frequently (, in minutes,) the endpoint will be contacted
| | Format | The format of the file you have produced, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``

## Example

```xml
<EndpointConfig>
    <OrderDownload>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/Orders</URL>
        <Format>XML</Format>
        <Frequency>15</Frequency>
    </OrderDownload>
    <OrderStatusUpload>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/OrderStatus</URL>
        <Format>XML</Format>
    </OrderStatusUpload>
    <StockStatusUpload>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/StockStatus</URL>
        <Format>XML</Format>
    </StockStatusUpload>
    <StockUpload>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/Stock</URL>
        <Format>JSON</Format>
    </StockUpload>
    <CReturnDownload>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/CustomerReturn</URL>
        <Format>JSON</Format>
        <Frequency>15</Frequency>
    </CReturnDownload>
</EndpointConfig>
```

# Security

It is advised that all endpoints are secured via HTTPS. The API also supports HTTP Basic Authentication for all operations, it is recommended that these values are validated accordingly. Basic Auth can be setup within the KC application/channel screens of KCC.

# Data Continuity
You may need to keep track of what data has been processed by us, especially when importing large quantity of orders or potentially recovering from an error. To tackle this, you can pass through a a HTTP Header called ``Sirion-Continuation``, this can have any value you like and will be passed back to you, as demonstrated in the following scenario:

> You have 1200 orders to import but you find it best to import 1000 at a time,  by passing through a Sirion-Continuation HTTP header with the value of 1000, the next time we request the orders you will be able to grab the reference of “1000” and make the following 200 orders available for import.

## Retrying Orders

Khaos Control Cloud allows you to retry the download of previously failed orders. When this happens Sirion will send a header to your endpoint called ``SpecificIDs``. When this is present in your headers you need to provide just the requested orders, rather than all of them.

> ``SpecificIDs: "AREF1531082922"``

If multiple orders are set to retry then the header will have multiple comma seperated values, for example:

> ``SpecificIDs: "AREF1530082911,AREF1531082912"``

## Objects

### Customer

The ``Customer`` object is made up of the following properties:

Name | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**CreateNew** | String | Yes | Can either be ``IfNoMatch``, ``Always``, or ``Never``. This ensures that a new customer is created if one does not already exist, without a customer being assigned the order will not import
**CompanyClass** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | Yes | Which classification this customer is in. All customers **must** have a classification
**Currency** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | Yes | What currency this customer purchases items in. All customers **must** have a currency. This cannot be changed once a customer has transactions recorded against them
**OtherRef** | String | | A reference, which is unique for other users
**WebUser** | String | | The username of the user
**CompanyType** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | The company classification, which can be set in the System Data area of Khaos Control Cloud

**OrderNote** | String | | The note for the order
**InvoiceNote** | String | | The invoice note for the order
**DeliveryDate** | [``DateTime``](#datetime) | | Which date the order should be delivered on. If this field isn't locked, Khaos Control may recalculate it based on rules
**RequiredDate** | [``DateTime``](#datetime) | | The latest possible date the customer has indicated the order can arrive. Distinct from ``DeliveryDate``, this field implies the order could arrive earlier, whereas ``DeliveryDate`` implies a specific day the order must arrive on
**PONumber** | String | | Customer's PO (Purchase Order) reference. Usually relevant for business customers paying on account
**DeliveryCharge** | [``Price``](#price) | | Amount charged for delivery. If omitted, the system will calculate delivery (unlikely to be desirable for web orders.) To indicate free delivery, include this field and set either the Net or Gross values to 0.

**RemainderOnAccount** | Boolean | |
**CalcMethod** | Integer | | Can either be ``0`` for Auto, ``1`` for Gross, or ``2`` for Net. Choose the best option based on the type of customer/order.

## Order Status Upload

Defined as ``OrderStatusUpload`` in your ``configuration file``, the API will push information as a ``POST`` to the endpoint in your desired format. This will occur when an order has been moved through the Sales Invoice Manager in Khaos Control Cloud, and it will only send the statuses for the orders that it has downloaded from the web service.

## Stock Status Upload

Defined as ``StockStatusUpload`` in your ``configuration file``, the API will ``POST`` a request to your endpoint in the data format you specified. This will occur when a stock adjustment is made, or the level of stock is changed automatically. You do not need to respond to this request, and you will receive between 0 and 100 stock items per request.
